- âš¡ Fun fact: I played softball in Highschool and was the catcher for our team.
- Bio: I recently got married almost a year ago. I currently work at a flowershop designing and I make some pretty awesome arrangements. I love to go hiking, skiing, spending time outdoors and with my husband. I want to help with business consulting when I have finished my degree. I enjoy being able to make the projects from class and see how a few lines of code can make something really come to life! I hope to be able to use this skill in my career to help struggling businesses or websites.
