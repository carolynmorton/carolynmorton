### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**carolynmorton/carolynmorton** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

--> ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on earning my bachelor's degree in Technological Entrepeneurship Management
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on internships
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I played softball in Highschool and was the catcher for our team.
--> I recently got married almost a year ago. I currently work at a flowershop designing and I make some pretty awesome arrangements. I love to go hiking, skiing, spending time outdoors and with my husband. I want to help with business consulting when I have finished my degree. I enjoy being able to make the projects from class and see how a few lines of code can make something really come to life! I hope to be able to use this skill in my career to help struggling businesses or websites.
